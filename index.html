         <h2>Valorant Tracker is a program that has almost the same features as BLITZ or TRACKER.GG</h2>
         <br>
         <h2>You can get a player's account level, their current rank with MMR and RR.<br>
            You can see his headshot rate, winrate and average K.D of the last 10 matches.<br>
            There is also a function where you can get match details from a match!<br>
            You have a complete view of the previous ranks of the old episodes and acts and a match history of the last 10 matches.<br>
            If you dont like the Light mode you can easily switch to Dark mode with clicking on a button.<br>
            <br>
            <img class="image" src="Images/Leaderboard.png" alt="LEADERBOARD"><br>
            Valorant Tracking also has a LEADERBOARD function where you can almost every player in the leaderboard.<br>
            You can see his rank, rr and his currently placing!<br>
            (Reminder: Sometimes you can't get all players because the api has problems with the leaderboard sometimes. That means you only can up to 1000 persons sometimes!)<br>
            <br>
            <img class="image" src="Images/Bundle.png" alt="BUNDLE"><br>
            This function of the tracker allows you to see all current bundles in Valorant, no matter how many bundles there are!<br>
            <br>
            <img class="image" src="Images/Soon.png" alt="SOON"><br>
            This last function is showing you almost all details about a match like all kills of a player, deaths of all players, headshotrate, ranks of them and other things! (CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPEMENT AND BETA)!
