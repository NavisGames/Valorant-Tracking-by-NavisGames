# Valorant Tracking by NavisGames

Want to track your enemies ranks but forgot to open Valorant Tracker or Blitz?
Use this Valorant tracker made with Python and PYQT to check stats very quickly!

# 💠 Functions:

- View a player's account level
- See a player's rank and MMR
- See his last games
- See how much RR he made
- See accuracy, winrate and average K.D and other stuff of recent games
- Check out the global leaderboards of *almost* every act in every region
- View current in-game bundles including skins, their prices and how long they will remain in the store.

And many more functions!

# ❓ Q&A

### Q: Why is the program detected as a virus?

A: Usally this program should not be detected as a virus. PyInstaller is the program I used to convert Python into an EXE file. PyInstaller is also often used to create viruses, keyloggers, and other malicious software. In other words, Py to Exe is not a true compiler, but rather a container in EXE format that runs at startup in addition to your Py file. It also secretly writes the necessary runtime to the disk and runs it automatically. This behavior is similar to that of trojans and other malware, as evidenced by the VirusTotal link provided to show that this program will not harm your computer:

### Q: What if my names contain spaces?

A: No problem! Just add the spaces in the program. The program recognizes the spaces ^^

### Q: What if the program contains bugs? How should I report them?

A: Just open an issue :) I'll take a look when I have time
