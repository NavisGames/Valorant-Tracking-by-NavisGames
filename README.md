# Valorant Tracking by NavisGames

You want to track Ranks from your enemy's but forgot to open Valorant tracker or Blitz?
Use this Valorant Tracker made with Python and PYQT to check their stats very fast!

# üí† Functions:

- See a players account level
- See a player's rank and MMR
- See his last matches
- See how much RR he made
- See Accuracy, Win rate and Average K.D of the last matches
- See global leaderboard of *almost* every act in each region
- See current bundles in the game including skins, their prices and how long they are remaining in the store.

And many other functions!

# ‚ùì Q&A

### Q: Why is the program detected as a virus?

A: IMPORTANT! Stay calm. The program is NOT a virus. The program I used to make Python into an EXE file is called PyInstaller.

Lots of viruses, keyloggers and other stuff are also built with Python and PyInstaller.

i.e. Py to Exe is not a real compiler, but just a container in Exe format, which when you start it, in addition to your
Py file, also secretly writes the necessary runtime to disk and also executes it automatically.
This behavior is heuristically
consistent with Trojans and other malware.

Here is a VirusTotal Link to prove that this program doesn't harm your computer:

### Q: What if my Names have spaces

A: No problem! Just put the spaces in the program. The program recognizes the spaces ^^

### Q: What if there are any Bugs in the program? How should I report them?

A: Simply open an Issue :) I will look at it as soon as I have time.
