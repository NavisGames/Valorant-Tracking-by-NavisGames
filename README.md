# Valorant Tracking by NavisGames

Want to track your enemies ranks but forgot to open Valorant Tracker or Blitz?
Use this Valorant tracker made with Python and PYQT to check stats very quickly!

# üí† Functions:

- View a player's account level
- See a player's rank and MMR
- See his last games
- See how much RR he made
- See accuracy, winrate and average K.D and other stuff of recent games
- Check out the global leaderboards of *almost* every act in every region
- View current in-game bundles including skins, their prices and how long they will remain in the store.

And many more functions!

# ‚ùì Q&A

### Q: Why is the program detected as a virus?

A: The program is NOT a virus. The program I used to turn Python into an EXE file is called PyInstaller.

Many viruses, keyloggers and other things are also built with Python and PyInstaller.
i.e. Py to Exe isn't a real compiler, just a container in exe format that runs on startup in addition to your
Py file, also secretly writes the necessary runtime to disk and runs it automatically as well.
This behavior is heuristic
consistent with trojans and other malware.

Here is a VirusTotal link to prove that this program will not harm your computer:

### Q: What if my names contain spaces?

A: No problem! Just add the spaces in the program. The program recognizes the spaces ^^

### Q: What if the program contains bugs? How should I report them?

A: Just open an issue :) I'll take a look when I have time
